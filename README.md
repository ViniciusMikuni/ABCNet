# ABCNet: An attention-based method for particle tagging.

This is the main repository for the   [[ABCNet paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05311).
The implementation uses a modified version of [[GAPNet]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08705) to suit the High Energy Physics needs. Nevertheless, the main structure of the code and main assets can be found in this [[repository]](https://github.com/FrankCAN/GAPointNet).
